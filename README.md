Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

Welcome to MY Unsplash, a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack. The app allows users to add, view, search, and delete images, and was designed with scalability and efficiency in mind. In this repository, you'll find the source code for MY Unsplash, as well as instructions on how to set up and run the app on your local machine.

Frontend development:
To build the frontend of MY Unsplash, I used React.js to create the components and structure the app. I also integrated Tailwind CSS to style the UI and ensure consistency across the app. One challenge I faced during the frontend development was managing state and passing data between components. To overcome this, I used React hooks like useState and useContext to manage the app's state and improve performance.

Backend development:
For the backend development, I used Express and Node.js to create the API and implement the CRUD operations. I also used design patterns like MVC (Model-View-Controller) to ensure the API was scalable and maintainable. To enhance the backend development, I used third-party libraries like Mongoose to interact with MongoDB and handle data validation and sanitization.

MongoDB integration:
To store and manage the app's data, I used MongoDB, a NoSQL database that is well-suited for scalable and dynamic web apps. I designed the database schema to store images, user data, and metadata, and ensured data consistency and integrity by implementing proper validation and error handling.

App features:
The main features of MY Unsplash include adding and viewing images, searching for images based on keywords, and deleting images. To implement these features, I used a combination of React components and API calls to interact with the backend and retrieve and manipulate data. I also used third-party APIs like Unsplash to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience.

Development process:
During the development process, I used tools like Git for version control and Jest for testing. I also followed best practices like writing clean and modular code, using descriptive variable names, and documenting my code for future reference. I worked iteratively and made sure to test and debug my code regularly to ensure the app was functional and bug-free.

Installation and usage:
To run MY Unsplash on your local machine, follow the instructions in the README file. You'll need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed, as well as some other dependencies. Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the app using the npm run dev command.

Reflection:
Building MY Unsplash was a challenging yet rewarding experience. I learned a lot about the MERN stack and how to create scalable and efficient web apps. I also learned about the importance of testing, documentation, and good coding practices in maintaining code quality and readability
